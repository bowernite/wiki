# Software Tooling

## JS WSYIWYG Editor

_Added Jan 2022_

- DraftJS seems to be the best
- Another option: QuillJS / react-quill
  - Might be undesirable, since they mix controlled / uncontrolled

## Observability

- [AWS RUM – Real-User Monitoring for Amazon CloudWatch | AWS News Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/cloudwatch-rum/)
  - Browser JavaScript code that handles Telemetry data, JavaScript errors, HTTP errors
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/)
  - Client side error handling
  - Also has some traces functionality

## Dev tooling

- [Trunk - More automation around linting, formatting, merging, etc.](https://trunk.io/)
- [Hoppscotch (Postman Alternative) - Open source API development ecosystem](https://hoppscotch.io/)
