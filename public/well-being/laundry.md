# Laundry

## Fabric Softener

- Fabric softener and dryer sheets basically add a coating of some material to the fabric
- That’s what makes it _feel_ “soft”
- This has the downside of ruining some clothing
  - DriFit
  - Some materials (merino wool, for example, says don’t use fabric softener)
- Basically, so long as you’re doing big general loads, don’t do it
- If you get to the point where you’re doing specialized loads, you could look into this again
  - But right now it’s not really worth the trouble

## Socks

- Wash inside out **if it’s sweaty and nasty in there**
  - Washing inside out helps wash the dirtiest, sweatiest parts better
  - But, I’ve seen it possibly tear some threads loose
  - And, sometimes the outside is the dirtiest (dirt from the floor, etc.)
  - So only do it if you really feel like the inside needs cleaning
- Hang dry if possible for soft socks you want to preserve
  - Helps preserve material
  - Friction and heat of the dryer break down the cotton/material
- For socks that aren’t a big deal (athletic socks), just tumble dry low
- Cold water
- Gentle/delicate loads
  - Prevents rubbing against other clothes
- No fabric softener
  - Reduces the sock's moisture wicking
- Use mild soap/detergent
- Don't fold
  - Helps them lose shape
- Buy high quality socks

## Jeans

- Wash infrequently — washing breaks down the material and fades the dye
- When you do wash, use delicate detergent
- If you need to use detergent, use bleach-free for dark colors (like Woolite Dark)
- Best option is to hand wash them
  - Soak in cold water and vinegar
  - If necessary, hand wash cycle with vinegar
  - Or, instead of vinegar, delicate detergent mentioned above
- No how water or heated dry
- Tumbling in dryer leads to wear and tear
- Otherwise, do it inside-out with like colors
  - Q: Should it be washed with other things?
- Q: Tumble dry low or hang dry? (probably hang dry)
- Can use Mr. Black’s spray to “freshen” them up without washing them completely
- Wearing a lot without washing them starts to stretch out the fabric
  - When you wash them next, they’ll probably be a bit more snug (waist, calves) for a few wears
- To help prevent fading, **stay out of sunlight** …😂

## Athletic clothes / dry fit

- Don't use fabric softener (kills the moisture wicking surface)

## Default routine

If no tag and not sure what to do:

- Wash on cold
- If socks, nicer material, delicate or in anyway, underwear, or especially dirty, jeans, **wash inside-out**
- Try not to overload washing machine (if overloaded, clothes tend to get more wrinkly)
- Drying
  - **Air dry** if nicer material, socks, delicate in anyway
  - Otherwise, put in drier on lowest heat setting
  - Some nicer materials like superfine merino recommend laying flat to dry
    - Never had a problem with them not being flat FWIW
- Don't iron logos that are e.g. plastic
- Iron on lower heat settings when in doubt. But follow material settings / guidelines

## Notes

- Underwear and socks need to be washed every time
  - But socks can go another round if you really didn’t sweat or anything — per-case basis
  - Underwear just go through a lot during the day — sweat and dead skin
  - Underwear also get stretched out throughout the day
  - Q: With new, nicer Mack Weldon underwear material, could we go two wears, or no?
- Merino wool
  - Wash after the first 2-3 wears
  - Q: How often to wash after that?
  - **Don’t tumble dry**
- In general, don’t tumble dry things you really want to preserve
  - Clothing breaks down from heat and friction in the dryer (that’s where lint comes from)
